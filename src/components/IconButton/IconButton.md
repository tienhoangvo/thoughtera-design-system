# Icon buttons
Icon buttons help people take supplementary actions with a single tap.

Use icon buttons when a compact button is required, such as in a toolbar or image list. There are two types of icon buttons: standard and contained.

## Takeaways
- Icon buttons can take the form of a wide range of system 
- Ensure the meaning of the icon is unambiguos
- On hover, include a tooltip that describes the button's action, rather than the name of the icon itself
- Use the outline-style icons to indicate an unseleted state and a filled style to indicate selection
